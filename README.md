# Planet-Terp-API-Examples
This API Example includes an object, **PlanetTerp.py**, which can be created and called in order to access information from the PlanetTerp API. 

The `PlanetTerp` object uses the requests and json packages. To install them to your computer, use something like `pip3` or `brew`. 

The `requests` packages allows the `PlanetTerp` object to access data from the internet, enabling it to make API calls. The `json` package converts the JSON data provided by the PlanetTerp API into a Python dictionary for easier use. 

You can find examples of how to use a PlanetTerp object in the **sample_usage.py** file.

To use this code to access the API, simply download or clone this repository, and make your own file in the same folder as **PlanetTerp.py** and **sample_usage.py**.
